Did you lost what you were doing when testing CSS stuff on browser? Not anymore. 
Get a history on console for the changes while doing changes on the elements tab. 

How to use: on console copy and paste the script. The "all levels" details must be signed on. 

On elements tabs, start to change CSS and voilá: you get an array with what has changed.


On the example bellow, the background color was changed to violet and there is a register on console. Easier to remeber what was done to write code after.
